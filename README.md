# MusicPlayer
A basic music player with simple swing GUI capable of playing wav audio files.
I plan adding more features and developing this to something that's at least somewhat useful.
For more features visit the projects tab!

Main features:
- Playing core Java supported file(s) (WAV)
- Looping
- Media controls (skip 10 seconds back and forward)
- More to come...
