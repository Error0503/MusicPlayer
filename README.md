# MusicPlayer
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk13-downloads-5672538.html">JDK 13.0.1</a> or above!

A basic music player with simple swing GUI made as an experiment in java.
I plan adding more features and develop this to something that' at least usable.
For more features visit the projects tab!

Main features:
- Playing core Java supported file(s) (WAV)
- Looping
- Media controls (skip 10 seconds back and forward)
- More to come...
